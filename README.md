# PythonCheckers
In order to learn Python, I decided to develop a simple GUI based Checkers game. Implemented using Tk GUI library, it was a great project that allowed me to explore the language and create something fun at the same time. 

Getting Started
1. Clone the respository.

    $ git clone <link-to-repo>

2. Check that python is installed

    $ python --version

3. If python is installed, run the app

    $ python "__init__.py"

4. If python is not installed, install python and run the app.

    $ brew install python

    $ python "__init__.py"

5. Enjoy your game of checkers!
